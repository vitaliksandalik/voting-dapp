# Voting DApp

I've revisited my 4-month-old Voting DApp and spent the entire night refactoring the code. Nonetheless, it's still not even close to being perfect, gonna work on that.

## Sneak Peek

Quick overview of the Voting DApp in action:

## Project Structure

- `client/`: Contains the React front-end application, enabling users to interact with the smart contract on the blockchain.
- `server/`: Hardhat environment for smart contract development, including compilation, deployment, and testing.
- In this context, the "server" refers to the blockchain infrastructure.

## Upcoming Features

1. **Enhance Voting System**: Implement additional features such as weighted voting or reassigning votes.
2. **Show All Recent Voting Transactions**: Develop a section in the UI to display recent voting transactions, enhancing transparency.
3. **Display the Winner**: Automatically calculate and display the winning candidate based on the votes once the voting period ends.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Voting DApp, refer to the README files located in the `client/` and `server/` directories for detailed setup and deployment instructions.
